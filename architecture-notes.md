Project architecture choices: 

Types of Messages in Your Flow
Request Queue (Java Backend → Model Inference)
Type: Each REST request (audio segment, metadata, etc.) is enqueued for processing.
Pattern: Task queue (work queue) — each request should be processed by one model backend.
Ordering: Somewhat important, but not critical.
Volume: Moderate to high, but not “big data” scale.
Latency: Low latency preferred.
Response Queue (Model Inference → Java Backend)
Type: Status updates (e.g., “downloading”, “creating”, “guessing”, progress %) and final result (plugin file or link).
Pattern: Pub/sub or direct response — backend listens for updates/results for each request.
Ordering: Important for status updates (should be in order for a given request).
Volume: Low to moderate.
Latency: Low latency preferred.
RabbitMQ vs Kafka: Which to Choose?
RabbitMQ
Strengths:
Excellent for task queues, work queues, and request/response patterns.
Built-in support for message acknowledgments, retries, and dead-lettering.
Lower latency for small/medium workloads.
Easier to set up and manage for transactional, per-request flows.
Good for real-time status updates and direct response patterns.
Weaknesses:
Not designed for very high-throughput, persistent log storage, or event sourcing.
Kafka
Strengths:
Designed for high-throughput, distributed event streaming.
Excellent for event sourcing, log aggregation, and big data pipelines.
Retains messages for a configurable time (not just until consumed).
Scales to very high volumes and many consumers.
Weaknesses:
More complex to set up and manage.
Higher latency for small, transactional workloads.
Overkill for simple request/response or work queue patterns.
Recommendation for Your Use Case
RabbitMQ is the better fit for your system because:
You need a reliable task queue for request dispatching.
You want low-latency, ordered status updates and results.
Your message volume is not at Kafka’s “big data” scale.
You want easier setup and management for transactional flows.
Kafka would only be preferable if you expect to scale to massive event streams, need to replay events, or want to integrate with big data analytics.
Summary Table
Feature/Need	RabbitMQ	Kafka
Task/work queues	✅ Excellent	🚫 Not ideal
Pub/sub (status)	✅ Good	✅ Good
Low latency	✅ Yes	🚫 Higher
High throughput	🚫 Not for big data	✅ Yes
Message ordering	✅ Per-queue	✅ Per-partition
Message retention	🚫 Until consumed	✅ Configurable
Setup/management	✅ Easier	🚫 More complex
Message Flow Recap
Request Queue:
Java backend enqueues each REST request.
Model inference backends consume and process requests.
Response Queue:
Model inference backends publish status updates and final results.
Java backend consumes updates/results and responds to the client.
Conclusion:
Go with RabbitMQ for both request and response queues for your current architecture and needs.

Why choose rmq: 

RabbitMQ (RMQ) is suitable for both request and response queues in your architecture.
Why RabbitMQ Works for Both Queues
Request Queue
Pattern: Work queue (task queue)
Behavior: Each request is delivered to exactly one model inference backend for processing.
Ordering: RabbitMQ guarantees that messages in a single queue are delivered in the order they were enqueued (FIFO), as long as:
There is only one consumer per queue, or
Each message is acknowledged before the next is delivered (no prefetching or parallel consumption).
Response Queue
Pattern: Status/result updates (can be direct or pub/sub)
Behavior: Model inference backends send status updates and final results back to the Java backend.
Ordering: For a given request (correlation ID), all status updates and the final result should be sent in order. If all updates for a request are sent to the same queue, and the Java backend processes them in order, ordering is preserved.
How to Ensure Ordering in RabbitMQ
Single Queue, Single Consumer (Strict FIFO)
If you have one queue and one consumer, messages are always delivered in the order they were enqueued.
Multiple Consumers (Parallelism)
If you have multiple consumers, RabbitMQ will round-robin messages between them, so global ordering is not guaranteed.
Per-request ordering: If all messages for a given request (e.g., all status updates and the result) are sent to the same queue and processed by the same consumer, ordering is preserved for that request.
Message Grouping (Advanced)
You can use message properties (e.g., a correlation ID or request ID) to group messages.
The consumer can buffer and order messages by request ID if needed, but this adds complexity.
Publisher Confirms and Acknowledgments
Use publisher confirms to ensure messages are enqueued in order.
Use manual acknowledgments to ensure messages are processed in order.
Best Practice for Your Use Case
Request Queue:
Use a single queue for all requests.
Each model backend instance can be a consumer (parallel processing).
Ordering is preserved per queue, but not globally if multiple consumers are used (which is fine for task distribution).
Response Queue:
Use a single queue for all status/result messages.
The Java backend consumes messages and can process them in order.
Use a correlation ID (request ID) in each message to associate updates/results with the correct client request.
If strict ordering is needed for updates/results of a single request, ensure all such messages are sent to the same queue and processed by the same consumer.
Summary Table
Scenario	Ordering Guarantee	How to Achieve
Single queue, 1 consumer	Strict FIFO	Default
Single queue, N consumers	Per-consumer FIFO	Not global, but per consumer
Per-request ordering	FIFO per request	Use correlation/request ID
Conclusion:
RabbitMQ is suitable for both request and response queues.
Ordering is preserved per queue and per consumer.
For per-request status/result updates, use a correlation ID and ensure all related messages are sent to the same queue and processed by the same consumer for strict ordering.
